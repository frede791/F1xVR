1. Add a 3D sphere to the SampleScene, parallel to the monza_res3.
2. Attach MoveSphere.cs script to the 3D sphere.
3. Add camera to the scene if wanted.
4. Play it and view the result.

For the z-axis in the map (the gravity axis), I did not set car.z, which can be obtained from the retrieved data. Instead I added mesh collider component (in the Inspector) for the map and rigidbody component for the sphere so then it will have gravitational force. I havenâ€™t tried setting the car.z, can be tried.

The Monza_traj.py will generate data and plot for this race in Monza. Might be helpful for coordinate transformation.


## (Accurate) tracking on Monza
- Follow the steps above to create a sphere at the origin (0, 0, 10). For better visibility increase the size to 10x10x10
- Remove the 90 degree x rotation from the monza map
- Set the transform position of the map to x = 150, y = 2398, z = 150
- Go Edit->Project Settings->Physics, make sure the gravity axis is in z, not default y.
- Run play, and if necessary swap from the "play" mode to "scene" mode to be able to watch the whole map.

### Notes on the SphereMove.cs script.
- Only transformations are setting the scale to 0.1 and flipping x inputs which seem to be mirrored against the orientation of the map.
- All other modifications are turned off.
